## 🧑‍💻Setting up Lab

### 👉Setting up Windows Machine for Malware Analysis
We’ll start by using Windows machine to examine a malware file.

📍[Download](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/) Windows 10 

📍[Install](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Python

📍[Install](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/hash_my_files.html) HxD to determine file type

📍[Install](https://github.com/SamuelTulach/VirusTotalUploader/releases) VirusTotalUploaded for file hash lookup

📍[Install](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss) FLOSS to decode Obfuscated Strings 

📍[Install](https://exeinfo-pe.en.uptodown.com/windows) Exeinfo for File Obfuscation 

📍[Install](https://www.winitor.com/download) PeStudio for file Inspection 


### 👉Download the Splunk Datasets

📍[Download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botsdataset/botsv2/botsv2_data_set.tgz) BOTS V2 Dataset [16.4 GB]. 

📍[Download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/botsdataset/botsv2/botsv2_data_set_attack_only.tgz) BOTS V2 Dataset(Attack Only) [3.2 GB] 

## 📁Use Cases
📍 **Insider Threat detectio**:Employ Splunk for real-time monitoring and analysis to swiftly identify anomalous user behavior, mitigating insider threats through timely detection and response.

📍 **Detecting Unauthoirized applications**: Leverage Splunk to monitor endpoint and network logs, promptly detecting and responding to the presence of unauthorized applications, bolstering security against potential risks.

📍 **Detecting Web-based attacks**: Utilize Splunk to analyze web server logs, identify patterns indicative of web-based attacks, and enhance cybersecurity posture through proactive detection and incident response.

📍 **Detecting SQL Injection attack**:Leverage Splunk's query and correlation capabilities to analyze database logs, promptly detecting and mitigating SQL injection attacks, strengthening resilience against this common web application vulnerability.

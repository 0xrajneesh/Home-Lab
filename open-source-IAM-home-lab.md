# Open Source IAM Home-Lab

## ℹ️Overview

This Home-lab focuses on Open-source Identity and Access Management tool. If you are interested to become a Security Engineer, this home-lab suite will help you set up a custom open source IAM solution.
Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution aimed at modern applications and services. It offers out-of-the-box support for web applications, single sign-on (SSO), two-factor authentication, and social login. 


## 🧮Requirements

**Hardware**: At least 4GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores (virtual or physical).  
**Software**:
- Docker and Docker Compose (for container management).
- JDK 11+ (if running Keycloak natively or for development purposes).

## </> Setting up Keycloak IAM

📍**Installation**: Use Docker for an easy setup. Follow the Keycloak [Docker Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker).  

📍**Initial Configuration**: Access the Keycloak Admin Console at http://localhost:8080/auth. Default admin credentials are used for login.  

📍**Create a Realm**: Realms manage users, credentials, roles, and groups. Creating a New [Realm Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#configuring-realms).  

📍**Define a Provider**: Organizations can have databases containing information, passwords, and other credentials. Add a [Provider](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#adding-a-provider)  

📍**Roles and Users**: Add roles and users under their respective tabs. Managing [Users and Roles](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#assembly-managing-users_server_administration_guide).

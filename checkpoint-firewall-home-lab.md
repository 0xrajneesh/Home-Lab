# Checkpoint Firewall Home-Lab

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èOverview

In this Home Lab, we‚Äôll learn to set up a Checkpoint firewall from scratch. This Lab will help you launch an attack with Nmap, Metasploit & custom scripts from Kali linux and defend your machine using a Checkpoint firewall.
## üßÆRequirements

- **Hardware**:
  - Computer with at least 16GB RAM and dual-core processor
- **VM/ISO Image**:
  - Checkpoint Standalone ISO file
  - Kali Linux OVA file
  - Metasploitable 2
  - Windows 11 OVA file

## üßë‚ÄçüíªExcercises- Network-based attacks
-  **Nmap Stealth Scan Detection**: Create a Suricata rule to detect TCP SYN packets sent to multiple ports within a short time frame, indicative of Nmap stealth scans.  
-  **Nmap OS Fingerprinting Detection**: Develop a Suricata rule to detect ICMP echo requests and responses with specific TTL values, characteristic of Nmap OS fingerprinting activities.  
-  **Nmap Service Version Detection Detection**: Formulate a Suricata rule to detect Nmap service version detection probes based on unique HTTP GET requests or TCP SYN/ACK packets.  
-  **Metasploit Exploit Payload Detection**: Craft a Suricata rule to detect Metasploit exploit payload traffic based on unique signatures or payloads commonly used in exploits.  
-  **Metasploit Reverse Shell Detection**: Develop a Suricata rule to detect Metasploit reverse shell connections by monitoring for outbound TCP connections to known attacker IP addresses.  
-  **Metasploit Meterpreter Communication Detection**: Create a Suricata rule to detect Meterpreter communication activities by analyzing HTTP or TCP traffic with characteristic Meterpreter payloads.
- **Metasploit Credential Harvesting Detection**: Formulate a Suricata rule to detect Metasploit credential harvesting activities by monitoring for specific LDAP or SMB traffic patterns indicative of credential theft.
